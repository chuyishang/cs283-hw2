    "# Assignment 2: Tokenization, Word Embeddings, and Vector Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore the problem of getting from sequences of characters to wordtypes with different meanings. You will implement widely-used algorithms for tokenizing text and computing context-less word embeddings, and perform analysis on the results of running these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning objectives:\n",
    "* Understand how byte pair encoding works as a method for tokenizing character sequences, and how it differs from simpler tokenization methods like splitting on whitespace.\n",
    "* Gain insights on how to compute and interpret language statistics, including Zipf's laws of word frequencies.\n",
    "* Understand basics of distributional semantics, including basic implementations of word embedding algorithms.\n",
    "* Learn to use vector algebra as a way of analyzing a space of word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "* In your solution, keep all code as-is except where it's explicitly mentioned to implement a function.\n",
    "* Items marked with a star (★) should be answered in a separate report as a text document with the corresponding item number. You will include your final report as a pdf with your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**\n",
