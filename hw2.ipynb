    "# Assignment 2: Tokenization, Word Embeddings, and Vector Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore the problem of getting from sequences of characters to wordtypes with different meanings. You will implement widely-used algorithms for tokenizing text and computing context-less word embeddings, and perform analysis on the results of running these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning objectives:\n",
    "* Understand how byte pair encoding works as a method for tokenizing character sequences, and how it differs from simpler tokenization methods like splitting on whitespace.\n",
    "* Gain insights on how to compute and interpret language statistics, including Zipf's laws of word frequencies.\n",
    "* Understand basics of distributional semantics, including basic implementations of word embedding algorithms.\n",
    "* Learn to use vector algebra as a way of analyzing a space of word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "* In your solution, keep all code as-is except where it's explicitly mentioned to implement a function.\n",
    "* Items marked with a star (★) should be answered in a separate report as a text document with the corresponding item number. You will include your final report as a pdf with your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**\n",

    "**Implement:** Two functions that map from tokenized sentences and words to contexts:\n",

    "##### a)  **Bag-of-Words Context** \n",
    "The first function should, for each target token $w$, create a positive example $(w, c)$ for every additional token $c$ in the sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "I.e., for a sentence $\\langle x_1, \\dots, x_m \\rangle$ of length $m$ tokens, we should create $m \\cdot (m - 1)$ positive examples: $\\bigcup_{1 \\leq i \\leq m} \\bigcup_{1 \\leq j \\leq m, i \\neq j} \\left\\{ (x_i, x_j) \\right\\}$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "##### b)  **Neighboring Tokens Context** \n",
    "\n",
    "The second function should, for each target token $w$, create a positive example $(w, c)$ for each of the tokens within a window of up to size $N$ before and after the target token's index. \n",

    "I.e., for a sentence $\\langle x_1, \\dots, x_m \\rangle$ of length $m$ tokens, we should create $m \\cdot 2N$ positive examples: $\\bigcup_{1 \\leq i \\leq m}\\bigcup_{1 \\leq j \\leq N}\\{ (x_i, (-j, x_{i-j})), (x_i, (j, x_{i + j}) )\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, contexts are  not just individual wordtypes, but the wordtypes are paired with some positive or negative distance away from the target token. For cases where the window is out of bounds of the sentence (i.e., $i - j < 1$ or $i + j > m$), you can create a special wordtype (e.g., \\<BOS\\> or \\<EOS\\>)."
